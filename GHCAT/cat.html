<p><font face="Arial"> All Furniture Treasure Island, Easy to find, everything showed on the map: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Includes all 1800+ furniture with displays. Although there is only one display for each furniture, the furniture you saw on the ground with the same name have all color variations. No Extras.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">All the furniture is catalog-able, which means once you picked them up, you will have the ability to buy them back from Nook Shopping. Therefore, you can choose to catalog them on my island or you can also choose to bring some to your island, whatever you think suits you best. When cataloging, please don't worry about messing things up, you can even toss all the un-wanted furniture in the trash bin (don't have to put them back to where they were one by one).
</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial"><span property="description">	Although I usually set your departure time as the starting time, kindly ask everyone to come quickly when you got the Dodo code and leave on time. Otherwise, there are basically no rules. Just feel free to loot anything during your time slot. You can take/drop anything, leaving the island the way you like and don't worry about messing things up. This service is intended for one player only, as multiple people may cause unstable Internet connection or other issues. </span></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" style="color: #353535"><b>Friendly reminder:</b>  You will need an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription service to visit other people's island. And you can also check your console connection by go to [Setting -> Internet -> Test Connection] if the NAT Type shows A or B, you will be alright. If it is C or D, you probably need to fix your Internet connection first.</font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial" style="color: #353535"> I always prepare the best network environment for you, but we all may experience interruptions at some point. Please don't panic, especially if you are not on the flight (leaving or joining), the gate is often still open and you can use the same Dodo code to come back. If you are experiencing disconnection while you on the flight, there is a high chance the whole connection will be lost. I will try to re-open the gate and give you a new Dodo Code ASAP. </font></p>
