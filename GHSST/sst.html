	  <q>I was able to get 3 trips done in 1 hour (120 items), but you'll probably get more trips done once you're familiar with her island. I was even able to get Dom to move into my island since she has 10 dreamies in boxes. Her island is perfectly organized, so I even decided to stock up on materials for the new DIYs I learned. She responds quickly as well so I am definitely going to purchase again soon.</q>
	  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
	  <q>Lots of good stuff! The entire iron-wood furniture collection (which I had 1 of the DIYs for but it needed 2 other DIYs from that set to make the kitchen set so I'm super happy I got them) I also got top to bottom a cool pirate costume. There was also the lucky cats and the DIY to make them gold! Lots of materials for all of the star/zodiac DIYs too!</q>
