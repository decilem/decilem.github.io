  <q>Can't say enough about the offering here! This was my second purchase to finish my photo collection. Thank you! A+++</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>The Ultimate Island was stocked with everything from live bugs, creatures, updated items and much more! I highly recommend 2 hours, one hour wouldn't have been enough for me personally, because there were so many items to choose from. Also, Stacy is super sweet and very quick to respond. I have never had an issue with lagging, connection, communication or interrupted by cutaways scenes from people.</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>Absolutely amazing! Everything is so well organized and there's just so much!!! Thank you!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>OMG! What an amazing experience!! I had such a good time picking out all my goodies!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  
</div>

<div class="mySlidess">
  <q>Seller set up the visit quickly and all went smoothly. It was a fun experience because everything was organized. Tip: Go to the island knowing what you need. It could get a little overwhelming. Seeing all that stuff could get you side tracked. Look at the map and plan accordingly. I already had a list of the recipes I needed and things I wanted.</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>TAmazing as always, I’m always ordering from their shop because their service always exceeds my expectations</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>Absolutely amazing seller! I’ve frequented this shop quite a bit and I must say that I’ve never been disappointed! She is very quick to respond and accommodating. Such a kind heart and pure spirit might I add. I have 8 homes on my island... all are 80-90% complete thanks to her!!! About to order again soon :)</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>Lovely seller, the island was easy to navigate and find everything I wanted. The hybrid flowers are well worth it, hard to find anywhere else. I highly recommend!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlidess">
    <q>So TBH I researched this about 2 weeks after getting the game. I am a true "pay to play" because my OCD makes me obsess and create till the island is perfect, down to colors. I cannot enjoy the game this way. This service is a GODSEND for people like me. I can now do what I want to design without limit and then get into actually playing and enjoying the time playing and making villager friends. I will be back - I will keep supporting Undertow and I am grateful for services such as this. THANK YOU!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>I’ve gone to this seller twice already. I’ve never spent money on getting things in the game but this seller had all that I needed! Now I have all the DIYs I wanted! Thank you!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>I think this may be my favorite treasure island. The seller was super nice and accommodating, and I got everything I wanted and more. Would definitely recommend this shop and island!!!!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>Everything I imagined and more. The owner was in touch immediately. The island was well organized and the included map was very helpful. Everything you need is there. Very friendly, I recommend.</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
</div>
<div class="mySlidess">
  <q>My favorite ACNH treasure island, and I've bought quite a few on etsy. This seller has absolutely everything to complete my home and museum (and I did), as well as the island decor. She was accommodating, readily available, and let me increase my time after the first hour to spend yet another hour on her island. I highly recommend this shop and treasure island. :-)</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>Very patient and kind, even gave me an extra 10 minutes because of a mess up on my half. Also gave me a coupon after my visit to treasure island! Will definitely buy from again!!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>The island was perfect, and was super organized! Quick responses, easy to work with. Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to visit a treasure island!</q>
  <p class="author">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
  <q>This is by far the greatest treasure island I’ve been on. It’s extremely organized and you have plenty of time to get the things you need</q>
